## Predicting NFL career longevity from draft / combined data

### Data
First draft model of 20 years of Draft and Combine data shows a modest (R_square ~ .25) using:
draft pick, age group (<25, >=25), college conference, and position group (backs, line, etc.)

For reasonable predictive power, I may need to break the model into separate regressions for each player type 
and introduce additional features (bench press, forty yard dash, etc. from combine or height / weight ).
