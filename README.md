# Linear Regression project proposal

## Problem
The National Football League (NFL) conducts a draft each spring of the ~250 or so top college players with much anticipation from the fans and prognostication from the pundits.  Every pick, of course, is made with much care, analysis, and fanfare. Results, however, vary widely. 

For example, of the players drafted in 2010, a number are still playing today, 11 years later, while a few never played in a single game. 
* Data statistics available vary by position, may narrow this down to QB, or WR for additional features, but then could be a little light on observations * 

Using linear regression, can we build an effedtive model to predict plery longevity as measured by games played (longer length as a proxy for a successful career)?


Features used may include:

- College
- Age at draft
- Pick number
- College games played
- Years Played in College



## Data Sources

NFL draft data - order, player, position, college
